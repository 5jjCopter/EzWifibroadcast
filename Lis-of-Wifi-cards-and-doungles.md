###Wifi Cards:
You have a lot of choice. All wifi cards with one of the following chipsets should work:

Atheros AR9271, Atheros AR9280, Atheros AR9287

The following Ralink cards supported: 
 - RT2070, RT2770, RT2870, RT3070, RT3071, RT3072, RT3370, RT3572, RT5370, RT5372, RT5572

However, there might be whatever small issues that prevent those cards from working, so if you want to play it safe, choose one of the cards that have been tested by different people and definitely work:

- CSL 300Mbit Stick (2.4/5Ghz, Diversity, RT5572 chipset)
- Alfa AWUS036NHA (2.3/2.4Ghz, high power, Atheros AR9271 chipset)
- TPLink TL-WN722N (2.3/2.4Ghz, Atheros AR9271 chipset)
- ALFA AWUS051NH v2 (2.4Ghz/5Ghz, high power, Ralink RT3572 chipset)

This ones also looks promising for high power needs:
- Alfa AWUS052NH (2.4Ghz/5Ghz, Diversity, high power, RT3572 chipset)

On the other hand, if everybody gets the same cards, we'll never find out which other ones work. There are also very small and lightweight RT5370 cards available in china shops for under 4$. Aliexpress for example has a lot of cheap wifi cards in general. It would be nice if you report back your findings in case you tried a wifi card that is not listed here.

###Tested wifi dongles
AWUS036NH, AWUS036NHA, AWUS051NH, TL-WN722N, TL-WN822N V2, CSL 300Mbit stick

(My favourites for 2.4Ghz are TL-WN722N and AWUS036NHA at the moment, for 5Ghz the AWUS051NH. The more I test with the CSL 300Mbit dongles, the less I like them, not much TXPower, unclean signal when TXPower raised, they seem to have problems with high power TX cards when used as an RX card (bad blocks when being to near) and somehow there seem to be more badblocks compared to the 722N when used on a wifi channel with other wifi networks.)
