- Display of good/lost packets to OSD for easier identification of interference
- dbm display now grows/shrinks depending on signal strength
- Default wifi bitrate reduced to 18mbit for ~3db higher sensitivity
- Default video bitrate increased to 6Mbit for higher video quality
- Default transmit power for Ralink cards is increased by 1db because of 18mbit wifi bitrate
- added 802.11n and 802.11b bitrates for Atheros cards
- Selectable configuration profiles via GPIO jumpers/switches
- lots of changes to the scripts to allow for fully automatic and dynamic detection of secondary display devices
- Forwarding of video stream and telemetry data to 2nd display via: USB Tethering, Wifi Hotspot, Ethernet, Wifibroadcast relay mode
- Bugfix: Some USB memory sticks were not correctly detected
- Bugfix: Video is now saved with correct fps if not using 48fps default setting
- Bugfix: With two or three Atheros cards, one wouldn't come up or receive no packets sometimes, should work stable now for up to three cards
- Bugfix: Ralink drivers caused a badblock every 10-20 seconds with Alfa AWUS051NH/052NH and other RT3572 based cards
- Disabled LED blinking on Atheros cards to avoid potential stability issues
- Raspberry Firmware upgraded to latest Raspbian release version
- RX overtemperature and undervoltage are now displayed with meaningful symbols
- Debug logs and screenshot will be saved to sdcard in case of errors
- Long recording times possible again. Use with caution, may lead to video stuttering or freeze!
- Recorded video will be played back while saving to USB
- Cosmetic fixes and quiet mode
