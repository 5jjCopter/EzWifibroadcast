### Read these instructions carefully and follow them! You'll very likely run into all kinds of strange problems, crashes, unstabilites, packetloss, bad blocks and glitches if you don't!

YOU NEED TO SUPPLY BOTH THE RASPBERRY PI AND THE WIFI CARDS WITH STABLE 5 VOLTS!

- use short wires
- use wires with atleast 20AWG gauge (0.5mmÂ²)
- solder _everything_, _avoid_ any USB cables or plugs (except on the 036NHA)
- use a quality BEC with atleast 3A
- consider adding low-ESR electrolytic caps near the wifi cards and Pi
- do _not_ use USB power banks
- do _not_ use the micro USB socket for power supply
- power through the GPIO pins
- make sure the camera cable is properly seated on both ends
- secure the camera cable with some tape or a drop of hotglue
- make sure the Raspberry and wifi cards don't get hot, consider heatsinks
