EZ-Wifibroadcast Version 1.2 has been released.

Changes from version 1.0 to 1.2:

- Befi's and Rangarid's OSD integrated
- Raspbian Update to Kernel 4.11 and latest Raspberry Firmware / Userland (Pi Zero/V2 Cam)
- Display of configured Frequency and FEC-Parameters at the bottom of the screen
- Ralink: Different bitrates for video and telemetry possible
- Ralink: Wifi bitrate can be configured via wifibroadcast.txt
- Atheros: Wifi bitrate can be configured via module parameter
- Ralink: TXPower can be configured via module parameter
- Supports V2 Cam 1280x720 up to 75fps, 1640x922 up to 48fps
- AIFS/Backoff parameters tweaked, Atheros chipsets now give about 10-15% more throughput, Ralink about 3%
- Atheros LED behaviour tweaked, blinks faster now, is "more sensitive"
- CPU/GPU/RAM overclocked and force_turbo activated for less/more stable Latency and higher possible bitrate on Pi1/Zero
- USB Ethernet Tethering support activated in Kernel (for smartphones)
- DHCP enabled on Ethernet interfac (system will contact the DHCP server with "wifibroadcast-tx" or "wifibroadcast-rx" hostname)
- Bash-prompt shows ro/rw status of the filesystem, macros ("rw","ro") added for quick switching
- Reduced TXPower for Atheros chipsets slightly (just to be on the safe side)
- Reduced TXPower for Ralink chipsets to default level
- Patched Atheros Firmware for additional Atheros Chipsets (AR9287, e.g. TPLink 822N V2)
- TX shows some status infos after startup
- video.c changed to 240fps for less latency/jitter
- addedd fflush to rx prozess (just to make sure ...)
- disabled Systemd journal daemon (used up CPU ...)
- Kept software, tools and libs etc. in the image, should make modifying or adding own features to the image easier
- Support for two TX wifi dongles. Experimental right now, not in the config file, has to be configured manually in Linux

Bugfixes:
- Potential rapidly raising latency, stuttering image on Pi1/Zero in some cases: overclocked CPU/GPU/RAM, force_turbo=1, enabled performance governoer, reduced bitrate to 4.5Mbit, video.c patched to 240fps, added fflush in RX process, removed systemd-journald

- AWUSH051NH and 052NH did not work cleanly as TX on 5Ghz band: Reduced TXPower for Ralink chipsets
