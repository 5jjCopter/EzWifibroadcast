This new BETA image contains the following changes made by user anemostec from rcgroups. It is technically a fork and is based on Stable v1.2 image. 

- kernel recompiled with full joystick support and 1000Hz interrupt modification suggested by rodizio
- befinitiv wifibroadcast code heavily revised to optimize serial communication
- RC command joystick support added with PPM frame support and almost zero latency (not measured yet but far below 100ms). compatible with almost every flight controler in the market
- USB tethering configuration activated by default 

For all serial communication, we have to use the new wifibroadcast library instead of the old tx and rx utility, an exemple has been provided with the joystick_send_command.c file. The pipe communication has been removed in order to further reduce the latency.

The PPM frame generation is made by an external arduino connected by usb to the raspeberry pi, the source code of it is available in the rc_landing directory
