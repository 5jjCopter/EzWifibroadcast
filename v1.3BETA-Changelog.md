- Startup scripts completely rewritten. They run on TTY1-TTY10 now and show if transmission/reception of video and telemetry is running, status info on wifi cards, memory sticks and android device, etc. etc. (not perfect yet, but should work)
- 2.5-2.7Ghz support for Atheros cards (Untested. Check which frequencies are allowed in your country and use some common-sense!)
- New raspberry firmware which fixes OSD freeze-up
- support for 2 TX cards for bullet-proof video link (tested, but needs more testing)
- Included mmormota's stutter-free hello_video.bin versions (seems to work great, the -sleep versions need testing though)
- USB tethering supported for display on android device (untested, but should work)
- Made Rangarid's OSD configurable (see osdconfig.txt)
- Added support for receiving telemetry data on RX serial port (for people with UHF telemetry transmission for example)
- Added support for serial data uplink (untested, may need manual fixing)
- Added support for RC over wifibroadcast via Joystick (tested, but needs more testing)
- Added screenshot support on RX
- Added dbm and packet/block display for video and telemetry data streams to OSD
- Re-written USB memory stick logic completely to fix stuttering issue when recording:
Video/Screenshots/Telemetry will now be saved to USB stick by simply plugging in the
memory stick _after_ flight
- OSD can be made translucent
- OSD update interval configurable
- Linux timer frequency increased to 1000Hz for less jitter and less badblocks in cases when one adapter has bad reception
- Fixed DNS resolv.conf not being updated by dhcp
- Login cleaned-up, no need to cancel stuff running on the console etc.
- Give error message and refuse to run when unsupported frequency is configured instead of silently falling back to the
lowest supported channel (to make sure users don't accidently use an undesired frequency)
- Check_alive function added which automatically restarts hello_video.bin in case it should crash
